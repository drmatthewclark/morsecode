tap out morse code telegraph messages in either authentic telegraph code or morse code

beep.py will create and play a sound file 'morse.wav' corresponding to arguments given to the program
e.g.  $ beep.py  hello how are you

The player is set to "mplayer" for linux but it can be modified for Windows.

both telegraph and morse feature Gaussian randomness to make the code a little less than perfect.
